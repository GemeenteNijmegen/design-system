# Layout developer documentation

## Requirements
- When using a component of this Design System you must use the Nijmegen layout conventions and the easiast way to implement them is to use the `@gemeentenijmegen/layout-css` package as it is;
- Spacing is set for all components in this design system, don't overwrite them with the space classes! These classes are ment for easy styling of your own elements;
- Container and grid options may be set in (larger) components, don't overwrite them with these container, grid or column classes! Container, grid and column classes are ment for consistent responsive placement of your own elements.

The following documentation is imported from the `@gemeentenijmegen/layout-css` package `README.md` file.
